# Strava_Visual_EDA
Exploratory Data Analysis through visualizations of a Strava workout dataset

Visualizations include the following:

## Boxplot
Explored the relationship between air power and heart rate via boxplots for various air power categories

## Ridgeline
Explored the progression of the average speed of workouts throughout the client's "Couch to 5k" program via ridgeline distributions
 
## Scatterplot
Plotted the average heart rate against the average speed of individual workouts to measure the relationship between faster running and higher heart rates.

## Mapping
Mapped the running workouts of the client to visually express their pathing. Information includes the start and stop point on markers, and average heart rate, average speed, and workout date on tooltip.

However, Folium is unable to render in a github notebook, so I've attached the static image.
